# University Ranking Analysis with Machine Learning

## Table of Contents

### Simple Linear Regression:
        simple_linear_regression  implements a simple linear regression model to predict the "Overall Scores" based on the "Research Quality Score." It includes model training, evaluation metrics, and a visualization of the regression line.

### Multiple Linear Regression:
        multiple_linear_regression extends the analysis to multiple features, predicting the "Overall Scores" using both "Teaching Score" and "Research Quality Score." It covers model training, evaluation metrics, and regression coefficients.

### Decision Tree Regression:
        decision_tree_regression utilizes a decision tree regression model to predict the "International Outlook" score based on "Teaching Score" and "Research Quality Score." It includes model training, evaluation metrics, prediction on new data, and visualization suggestions.
        
### Logistic Regression:

    logistic_regression introduces a logistic regression model to classify universities based on their "International Outlook" score. It includes model training, evaluation metrics, and predictions on new data.
